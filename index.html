                    Egoism,as a form of hedonism, is the doctirne which holds that we ought each of us to pursue our own greates gappiness as our ultimate end. the doctrine will , of course, admit that sometimes the best means to the end will be to give pleasure to others; we shall, for instance, by so doing , procure for ourselves the pleasure of sympathy, of freedom from interference, and of self- esteem; and these pleasures, which we may procure by something aiming directly at the happiness of other persons , may be greater than any we could otherwise get.

                        When one thinks of the labors which the the English have devoted to digging the tunnel under the Thames, the tremendous expenditure of energy involved, and then how a little accident may for a long time obstruct the entire enterprise, one will be able to form a fitting conception of this critical undertaking as a whole.

                        But the interest of the inquiring subject being merely historical, (whether he also has an infinite interest in Christianity in his capacity as believer, in which case the whole enterprise might readily come to involve him in several contradictions; or whether he stands aloof, yet, without any passionate negative decision qua unbeliver), he begins upon a tremendous task of research, adding new contributions of his own, continuing thus until his seventieth year. And this is the falsity that is inherent in all objectivity; and this is the significance of mediation as the mode of transition in the continuous process where nothing is fixed and nothing is infinitely decided; because the movement turns back upon itself, and again turns back, so that the movement becomes chimerical, and the philosopher is wise only after the event.

                        But if the pearl is in a far country, Africa for example, in a secret place difficult of access, if I have never had the pearl in my hand, and I leave home and kindred, give everything up, and undertake the long and toilsome journey without knowing for a certainty whether my enterprise will succeed; then I ventue – and it will not doubt be remarked the same evening at the club, just as the serous man put it, that it is madness on my part to risk everything.
